a. Full name (as in NRIC) and email address.

Hi there! Warmest greetings to you! My name is Joel Lim Ghim Seng and here's my email : Joel.Lim@AOL.com



b. Overview of the submitted folder and the folder structure.

I only managed to submit this README.md together with my best efforts and fair share in attempting the eda.ipynb



c. Instructions for executing the pipeline and modifying any parameters.

I am totally a noob and i started out myself to pick up Data Science from YouTubes and articles online. I am sorry that i couln't meet your expectations and this is what i can do at best. Sorry to take up your time to read this message of mine.



d. Description of logical steps/flow of the pipeline. If you find it useful, please feel free to include suitable visualization aids (eg, flow charts) within the README.

I learnt about OSEMN from other online experts and i went dare ahead to try out connecting to this home_sales.db following this framework or pipeline. It was "AWESOME" indeed as it throws me light and i sort of has a direction to move forward inside this thick vegetation. At least i tried! Thank you in advance for the time spent in reading this! I truely and sincerely appreciate!



e. Overview of key findings from the EDA conducted in Task 1 and the choices made in the pipeline based on these findings, particularly any feature
engineering. Please keep the details of the EDA in the `.ipynb`, this section should be a quick summary.

I scrub the data by replacing as much as i could all the null values / NaNs and screening out outliers mostly by using my business sense as well as some python tools i picked up online via self learning. The Obtaining data portion was already not a straight road for me because it wasn't the usual easy CSV file but SQLite database. I did it on that part! Yeah! Haha!



f. Explanation of your choice of models for each machine learning task.


g. Evaluation of the models developed. Any metrics used in the evaluation should also be explained.


h. Other considerations for deploying the models developed.
